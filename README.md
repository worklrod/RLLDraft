# RLL Draft
A website to facilitate a Little League Draft

## Requirements
* accept a list of player names (maybe a CSV or a spreadsheet)
* Accept a list of coach names to display whose pick it is.
* All player names will be displayed on the screen so that coaches can see who is available
* When a coach selects a player, that player will be removed and added to that coach's roster.
* The coach's pick order can be set at the start of the draft.
* Players can be marked as brothers who must go to the same team. When a coach picks one brother, both brothers are added to the coach's roster, and the coach's next pick gets skipped.
* A coach can be skipped (or pass) during a round to facilitate a brother pick.
- we also need to display the coaches name when it's their turn, and begin a timer.
